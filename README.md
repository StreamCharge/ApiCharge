# ApiCharge
Digital Service Monetization and Democratization

**Important note for SCF reviewers**: Code is private and proprietary. During phase 3 (see issue labels) the Soroban smart contract will be finalized and made public. The ApiCharge server platform binaries will be kept private permanently. Docker Images for the ApiCharge templates will not have their Dockerfiles made public. The Mac, Windows and Linux native wallet desktop manager apps will be closed source, and the future iOS, Android and Smart TV consumer apps will be closed source BUT with the support of the community, whitelabel/skeleton apps can be derived from these with ApiCharge and StreamCharge proprietary features removed, so that anyone may build native Stellar-integrated apps from a stable starting point, with secure key management, account management, and on/off ramping integrated.

## Overview

Please use this repo to log issues and request features.

Information, guidance, documentation, and code will be transferred to this site for the ApiCharge desktop B2B apps, mobile consumer apps, and server stablecoin/digital currency pricing and payment gateway. 

Public beta progress planned for the week of 27/Oct/2025

More to come...
